# Design, HTML & CSS #
For our design, we used agile processes to ensure efficiency.
We started with a basic template/deliverable for our website, allowing our backend developers to work on functionality whilst we prepared the css.
Next, we used Figma to develop an appealing UI/UX.
After the design was complete on figma, we began importing the CSS into the flask project.
From this point it was just a matter of styling additional functionalities and updates.

### Tools ###
For icons, we took them from Flaticon.com. For many we had to invert the coloring on Aseprite and others we had to edit the opacity.
For fonts, we used Roboto Mono from google fonts. I believe it fits the theme of a chatbot however it doesn't look so modern.
For font-size, we used Typescale.com to create pleasing font sizes.
