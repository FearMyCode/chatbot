# Purpose #
The purpose of the website was to provide a chatbot with good functionality and A smooth UI and UX.
We thought that ChatGPT had a lack of design and became too complicated so we decided to redesign it in a more simple and efficient way.
We didn't want to add a gimmick that would reduce the chatbot's functionality so we left it as is, with full interactability.

# Design, HTML & CSS #
For our design, we used agile processes to ensure efficiency.
We started with a basic template/deliverable for our website, allowing our backend developers to work on functionality whilst we prepared the finished CSS and HTML.
Next, we used Figma to develop an appealing UI/UX.
After the design was complete on figma, we began importing the CSS into the flask project.
From this point it was just a matter of styling additional functionalities and updates.

### Tools ###
For icons, we took them from Flaticon.com. For many we had to invert the coloring on Aseprite and others we had to edit the opacity.
For fonts, we used Roboto Mono from google fonts. I believe it fits the theme of a chatbot however it doesn't look so modern.
For font-size, we used Typescale.com to create pleasing font sizes.
